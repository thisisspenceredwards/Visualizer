<br>
Possible other features to implement for front end
<br>
dragable start and end locations
<br>
drag to add barriers as opposed to clicking each one
<br>
upon moving a start or end redraw the shortest path
<br>

6/10
<br>
implemented DFS
<br>
implemented BFS w/ return path
<br>
implemented barriers
<br>
updated UI
<br>
React hooks working

Todo:
<br>
More algorithms
<br>
Improve UI
<br>
test test test
<br>
begin working on backend
<br>
optomize react (unnecessary renders still happening)


6/2
Created prototype grid
Created start location and end location
For fun made squares change color on hover


todo:
  Lots!
  Likely begin tackling an algorithm next
  
  Todo:
  Depth,
  Breadth,
  etc
  
  Maybe add weights to graph?
  Menubar
  Animations
  Allow user to draw barrier
  Allow user to give various other inputs, size of grid, etc
  
  Farther along:
  Create backend
  Create API for frontend and backend to talk
